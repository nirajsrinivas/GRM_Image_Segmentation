# GRM_Image_Segmentation

To run, type on your console python3 image_segmentation.py pea.jpg (or another image name) --algo ap (ap for augmenting path and pr for push relabel) --size 30 (or any other number for an image of size n*n, maximum recommended upto 50*50)

This implementation requires quite a number of seeds for it to identify the borders, thus do feel free to add as many seeds as you can.
